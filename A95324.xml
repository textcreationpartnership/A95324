            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN Parliaments Aſſemble to Treat of the Grand Affairs of the Nation, 'tis uſual for men <hi>Without doors,</hi> to put into their Hands ſuch Schemes, and Projects, as they think may be Serviceable to the Publick. Nor is this Intermeddling of private men reckon'd Bold and Impertinent; but thoſe Great and Wiſe Heads vouchſafe to receive the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of men, ſometimes of little Figure, as readily as they do the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Injured perſons: They think 'tis reaſonable that they, who are Choſen to Enact Laws for the good of the Common-wealth, ſhould have a due regard, to what any Member of the Community propoſes for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. Beſides, they wiſely conſider, that men of ordinary capacities, may ſometimes hit upon lucky Thoughts, which they by cloſe Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their minds to them, may afterwards improve to the advantage of the Publick. When ſuch regard is ſhewn by Legiſlators, to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Private men, an honeſt man cannot well forbear Offering that to their Conſideration, which he believes will be a means of ſettleing the Peace and Proſperity of his Count<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>What I here propoſe, Sir, is what I think may have that good Effect: If the Wiſdom of the Nation Judge otherwiſe, I ſhall ſit down contented with the pleaſure of being miſtaken in my Zeal to ſerve my Country.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons which induced me to recommend this little Pamphlet to you, are more then one, you and your Ingenious and Worthy Friend Mr. <hi>St—y</hi> were privy firſt to the Writing of it; you have Intereſt both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as well as parts, to compaſs what it deſigns: The Method which it propoſes to promote the good of the Publick, is, in the main, agreeable to your Sentiments; and you want neither Courage nor Reſolution to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend warmly for that, which you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e perſwaded, is for the good of your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. What Entertainment it may meet with, I am not able to conjecture; your Name in the Front will give it ſome Reputation, and diſpoſe a great many to caſt an Eye upon it. To give it a little more Credit; I can ſay, that a Perſon of Place and Quality, related to you, and Dr. <hi>Wm. Mo—x</hi> to whoſe Judgement I have a very great regard; have viewed it, and paſſed their Cenſure upon it.</p>
            <p>The deſign of it is to ſhew, what you are throughly convinc'd of, that 'tis our great Intereſt to Encourage Forreign Proteſtants to live among us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> This is a ready way to make our Country Flouriſh; and the moſt effectual courſe that we have now left, in my opinion, to ſecure us a laſting Peace, and prevent ſuch Rebellions, as for above Five Hundred years together' ſince the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, have perpetually
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133423:3"/>diſturb'd this Kingdom; made it a Dear and Troubleſome purchaſe to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and an uncomfortable Habitation to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who have been Seated here.</p>
            <p>I know Sir, that our people (who are as apt to forget a Danger, as they are Bold to Encounter it, when it lyes in their way) do generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckon that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are ſo broken by the laſt Rebellion, that it will not be in their Power again to Diſturb the Peace of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> here, or to put <hi>England</hi> to any further Charge to Subdue them. I ſhall ſhew you, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have reckon'd too much after this rate formerly: and it may happen that theſe too Sanguine hopes may prove very deceitful, and be Fatal to them hereafter. I do not think that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are yet ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd, but that, if things run on in the old courſe, they may in proceſs of time meet with circumſtances that may favour other Rebellions. The Happines or Miſery of this Iſland, for the time to come, to me ſeems to depend on the prudent or ill management of the preſent. We have now an opportunity in our hands, ſuch as never yet offer'd ſince <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>how's</hi> Adventurers firſt brought their Arms into this Country, of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Foundation of a laſting Peace. I need not tell you, Sir, who are converſant in Hiſtories, and know the Changes and Revolutions of the World that the Flouriſhing Eſtate of ſome Countries, has been occaſion'd by the Ruin of their Neighbours, and the intolerable unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, that have forc'd them from their Habitations: the preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>France,</hi> and the uſage with Proteſtants meet with there, may be a means of raiſing the Power a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>alth of thoſe Neighbouring Proteſtant Countries which have Wiſdom and Goodneſs enough to take hold of the opportunity. The United Provinces, who know that they owe their greatneſs to the Troubles of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the concourſe of people from thence, who were Perſecuted for Religion; make the beſt hand they can of their Calamities. They Entertain the Perſecuted Hagonots with the greateſt Humanity, and are very liberal in their Charity to them. They know what the Reward of Charity is, and they know of what value people are to their State, they cannot Ingroſs all the Wrack of the <hi>French Church:</hi> the Providence of God ſeems to Deſign a part for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Security of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rty may by this means be throughly ſecured, and our Countrey rendred very flouriſhing. The Ground of this hope ariſes from His Majeſty's inclination to that People, and that Noble Perſon to whom he has given a ſhare in the Government. The King has always expreſſ'd a Chriſtian concern for them, and he has as often recommended their Condition to the Charitable conſideration of His Parliament, as he has deſir'd neceſſary Supplies, for carrying on the War. 'Tis not then to be doubted but that His Majeſty will Give them Encouragement to Settle, and Plant in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when he is perſwaded, that by their means he may do more to Secure the Proteſtant Intereſt of this Kingdom, which he preſerv'd with the hazard of His Life, than has been ever done heretofore.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133423:3"/>Thoſe who have a Love for <hi>England</hi> and the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Ireland,</hi> pure and free from all Mean, and Self ends, do hope that the King had ſuch a Deſign when he thought of making the Earle of <hi>Gallway</hi> one of the Triumvirat. It happens indeed very Providentially that he's a Perſon for his Courage, Knowledge, Temper, and Integrity, great in the eſteem of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as his own Country-men. 'Tis to be hop'd then that the great Opinion the <hi>French</hi> have of him, may encline mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them to come into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that by means of his Credit with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Methods may be contriv'd for their Settlement here. If any thing of this kind be done there will be many evil men of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering perſwaſions, byaſs'd by their Privat Intereſts, who will raiſe loud Clamours and Objections, and make it their Buſineſs to Obſtruct ſuch a Work. The deſign that I had in commiting my rude Thoughts to Writeing, was to ſet people on thinking of what may be for the Publick Intereſt of this Kingdom, and to anticipate all Objections which may be made againſt Forreigners being Planted here. A ſhort Undertaking of this kind, may have an uſe in it, which every one does not think of. When a Colony of men are Invited, or Receiv'd into a Country, 'tis for the Intereſt of the Publick, that, as ſoon as may be, they grow one both in their Intereſt and affections with the people, with whom they are Incorporated. This depends very much upon the Inclinations which men have towards them in the begining; for if at their firſt comming in, the Inhabitants are Prejudiced againſt them, from hence Animoſities will Naturally ariſe, and ſuch ill Blood may by degrees be bred in them, as may creat perpetual Feuds, oppoſit to the Intereſt of the State. 'Tis convenient therefore that they make their entrance with the good Will and Approbation of the People of the Land. This little Diſcourſe may be in ſome ſort uſeful to that end. In it I will ſhew that 'tis the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt both of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to encourage Forreign Proteſtants to ſettle here: and then I will propoſe ſome Incouragement to be given them.</p>
            <p>That 'tis the Intereſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> to Encourage For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Proteſtants to Live and Settle here,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>'Tis the Intereſt of</hi> Ireland <hi>to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Foreign Proteſtants.</hi>
               </note> the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Kingdom thought, when in the Year 1692. in my Lord <hi>Rumney</hi>'s time, they made the Act for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalization. They knew very well, that without many People, a Country can be neither Rich nor Secure; and that by making their Land a Place of Refuge and Sanctuary for Strangers, they took the moſt effectul courſe to increaſe their Strength and add to their Proſpority It happens ſometimes, that Laws which the Wiſdom of a Nation ſees are for the good of the Common-wealth; and are Enacted after the moſt mature deliberation, yet are too freely Cenſur'd, when they thwart the imaginary Intereſt of Privat men. This may very well be ſuppos'd to be the Fate of a Law which Enfranchiſes Strangers. If a Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is one of the firſt Rate Orators among the men of his Tribe, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that his Condition is rendred worſe than 'twas before, and thereupon Damn Forrigeners; and thoſe who made Laws to bring them in; others will be ready to follow the Cry, without examining whether there was Reaſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133423:4"/>for it or no that a Naturealization in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Encouraging ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants as the <hi>French</hi> are particulary (for our greateſt hopes are from them) cannot come under this cenſure I ſhall Endeavour to ſhew. Every one who knows the Condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> at this time, and has view'd the Scenes of it's former Troubles, muſt own that that will be of the greateſt advantage to it.</p>
            <p>Which will better the preſent Condition of the Country; and which will Settle and Secure it from ſuch troubles, and Rebellons as it has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been perpetually haraſs'd with, theſe will be the effects of Encouraging Proteſtants to Settle here.</p>
            <p>This will make the Condition of the Country better than 'tis. The way of the World is when they compare Countrys one with another, to take their Eſtimate from their Wealth, and Improvements of all ſorts; and to ſet the greateſt value on thoſe which are Naturally the beſt, and have the moſt Artificial Wealth and Furniture in them: Otherwiſe we muſt ſay, that all Countries are alike, and that <hi>Holland,</hi> which makes ſo great a Figure in <hi>Europe,</hi> is not to be valued above <hi>New Holland</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> which is Diſcrib'd to be one of the moſt miſerable places in the World. We may thus compare a Country with it ſelf, and viewing it in differing periods of time, reckon it in a better, or worſe Condition, according as we ſee it Flouriſh or Decay in it's Improvements or Wealth.</p>

               </abbr> And he that conſiders how many fair Ports do now lie idle, how thin of Inhabitants and Un-impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Land is in moſt places? will hardly ſay, that <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot be render'd more Flouriſhing than 'tis. It is ſure it may, but this muſt be by a greater multitude of People. Where there is ſo much Ground, and ſo few Inhabitants, it cannot be imagin'd that the People are able, by their utmoſt Labour and Induſtry, to raiſe all the rich Commodities and Fruits which 'tis naturally apt to produce; much leſs can we imagine, how the Countrey ſhou'd be Beautified and Enrich'd with Improvements: How the Foundations of new Towns or Cities ſhould be laid: or any conſiderable Additions made to the Old ones: How the Ports ſhould be made uſe of; or Ships ſent to Sea, when the Commodities of the Countrey lie in the Bowells of the Earth for want of Hands to force them out: Or how men ſhou'd trouble themſelves to go to Sea, and endanger their Lives in Fiſhing for Food there, when the Earth ſupplies them with plenty of Proviſions, and they may live ſecure in idleneſs, and almoſt in the forgetfulneſs of Labour on the dry Land. Theſe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133423:4"/>are the Practices, this the Condition of more Populous Countries: Where there are abundance of People, the Country, tho' the Barrenneſs of the Soil ſhou'd give the greateſt oppoſition, muſt neceſſarily become Wealthy. Crouds of People, upon the Breach of the Roman Empire, Raiſed the great City of <hi>Venice</hi> on thoſe little Rocks and ſcraps of Iſlands, which yielded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but an uncomfortable habitation to poor Fiſhermen.</p>
            <p>The United Provinces, which are now one of the great Bulwarks of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberties of <hi>Europe;</hi> were formerly, we know, of no great Conſideration, till great ſhoal's of people flock'd in thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and were forc'd in their own Defence, to take a great deal of pains, both in Labouring the Ground, and in Handicraft Occupations, to get a Livelihood. The ſtreights they were put to, made them Ingenious in their Inventions; and when they found they were pinch'd both in the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and produce of their Earth, they were forc'd to look for room, and proviſions in the Sea. By this means they fell into Navigation and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; grew vaſtly Rich; Built great Cities; and became the Envy of ſome of their Neighbours, and the Admiration of <hi>Europe.</hi> Theſe are the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Neceſſary Effects of much people: Countries muſt be Improv'd, and Enrich'd by them; and thoſe ſooner than others, which have the richeſt Soil, and are moſt favour'd by the Sea. <hi>England</hi> is as great an inſtance of this, as any other Country, for that great Wealth which it has acquired by the Improvement of the Woollen Manufacture (which is an unknown Treaſure) is owing to the <hi>Walloons,</hi> to whom Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> gave the greateſt Encouragement to come for ſhelter into <hi>England,</hi> from the Fury of the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi>'s Peſecution. But I ſhall make this plainer to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by giving them a ſhort view of ſomethings here in our own Country. There is in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> an Eſtate which was the Lord <hi>Conway</hi>'s, which the Lord Marqueſs of <hi>Normanby</hi> the other day enjoy'd in Right of his Lady, but now belongs to Mr. <hi>Popham Seym<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r:</hi> This Eſtate was formerly purchaſed by Sir <hi>Foulk Conway,</hi> Uncle to the late Lord, for about Five hundred pounds. The Rent-role of this Eſtate is now about Five thouſand pound <hi>per Annum:</hi> Thô there are many great, and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Leaſes in it, ſome worth about Four hundred pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> clear. The Land does not lye upon the Sea; the Ground but very indifferent; 'twas altogether a Wood, as the name <hi>Kilulta</hi> (the Wood of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi>) denotes, and yet in the Memory of men now living, has been thus improv'd by a Colony of <hi>Yorkſhire</hi> people, and orhers brought over, and Settled here by the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> and manag'd by Sir <hi>George Rawdon.</hi> The ſame Remarke may be made on the Neighbouring Country of <hi>Clan Hugh Boy,</hi> or <hi>O Neal's</hi> Country about <hi>Belfaſt</hi> and <hi>Carrickfergus,</hi> the former of which Towns is the third in <hi>Ireland</hi> for Number of People, and Trade; and yet grew up to what it is from nothing, in the Memory of People who liv'd but t'other day ſince Sir <hi>Arthur Chicheſter</hi> got that Eſtate. But why ſhould I mention particular Improvements? We know that till about the ſame time, the profits of <hi>Ireland</hi> in General, were very inconſiderable: The Rent which the Landlords receiv'd, was no more than what he and his Followers eat in their Coſhers: and the Publick Revenue was not equal to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:133423:5"/>the Charge of the State, till of late years. All the Advances which the Country made towards a better Fortune, were in proportion to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People who came over into this Iſland. In Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time after the Rebellions of <hi>Munſter</hi> were quell'd, ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> came over, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was occaſion'd by the Care which was then taken, in Planting the Eſcheated Countres with new Proteſtant Inhabitants, the <hi>Londoners</hi> Building <hi>Derry,</hi> and <hi>Colrane,</hi> and ſending people to Inhabit them; <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Lands of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> and <hi>Conway,</hi> and the Neighbouring places; and the concourſe of the <hi>Scotch</hi> out of <hi>Scotland.</hi> Theſe were only the firſt dawnings of Happineſs. After the War which began with the Rebellio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in Forty One was ended, and the Kingdom was ſettled in Peace; it began to Flouriſh indeed, and Improv'd every day. Then Houſes were Built; Manufactures ſet up; Lands Improv'd; and as they now yielded a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Rent to the Landlord, ſo were they reckon'd able to pay a Quit Rent to the King. This was the Condition of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, it grew every day in Proſperity: And the cauſe of this is very Obvious; the number of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> here, was grown greater then ever before</p>
            <p>The Army with which <hi>Cromwel</hi> Subdued the <hi>Iriſh</hi> was conſiderable: after the War was over, theſe continued in the Land; the Souldiers moſt of them, ſet down upon their Debentures; a great many Adventurers came over, brought <hi>Engliſh</hi> with them, and Planted the Eſtates which were given them for the Money they laid out to carry on the War. Theſe were men of another Spirit generally, and more oppoſit to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and their Barbarous Cuſtoms, then the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who came over before: which muſt be imputed to the great averſion and prejudice, which the Bloody Maſſacre in Forty One had Created in them. This new Colony put the <hi>Engliſh</hi> who came over before (who according to the old Cuſtom, were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating and growing <hi>Iriſh</hi>) in mind of their Origin; and help'd to keep them tite to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt, and Proteſtant Religion. By their means, Trade, Manufactures, and the Rents of Lands Increaſed dayly; and the State of the Kingdom was ſo Improv'd, that in the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Reign, <hi>Ireland,</hi> which before us'd to put <hi>England</hi> to a conſiderable charge, raiſed a Revenue of about 330000 <hi>

                  </gap>,</hi> and elſewere; we may reckon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of thoſe people would willingly upon any Encouragement, flock hither. But the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants are the people that we have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expectation from at preſent; and to me they ſeem to be ſuch as this Country ſhould deſire upon every account; and I think, if we conſider'd our true Intereſt, we ſhould make it our Buſineſs to give them all Incourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Invitations to come in, and Treat them with the greateſt Kindneſs and Civility when they are here. It muſt be owned, that, very often, men who remove from one Land to another, are perſons, who, by reaſon either of their Imprudence, or Extravagance, or Injuſtice, or Lazineſs, made their Lives uneaſie at home, and therefore were neceſſitated to change their Soil. No Country can be great Gainers by ſuch men as theſe. This is not the Caſe of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants: The Reaſon which made them quit their Country, is a very powerful one to Recommend them to the people of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They quitted their Country upon the account of Religion: This ſhould be a Motive to make us Value, and Entertain them. I do not here ſpeak of that Charity, and Compaſſion, which their Sufferings juſtly Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge from all, who pretend a Zeal for the Reformed Religion; (tho' upon that Account, it may be the Intereſt, as well as the Duty of People, to Treat them Hoſpitably; becauſe they may Entertain Angels unawares, and bring a Bleſſing upon the Land.) My Reaſon is an Argument to worldly Men, and is ſtrong in the plain point of Secular Prudence, and Intereſt, Abſtracted from all Religious Conſiderations. Men who forſake their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try upon the Account of Religion, are men of Principles and Conſcience: The very ſame Principle therefore, or Temper of Mind, which makes them ſcrupulous in the Caſe of Religion, we may rationally conceive, will encline them to be Sober, and Juſt, and Induſtrious in the works of their Calling. Such men as theſe are likely to make a Nation happy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants have many men of Letters among them, and they are generally remarkable for their good Breeding and Civility: 'Tis not to be doubted then, but that they Living in Towns, and Villages, among the ruder <hi>Iriſh,</hi> will in time help greatly to improve them, both in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Religion; Teach them a more Human way of Living; and thus drive them from that Native Barbarity, which has been a great Cauſe of their former Rebellions. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> have done much this way, but more had been done before now, had it been their good Fortune formerly, to have more people of good Manners, and Civility to aſſiſt them. 'Twas the Misfortune of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were but few in number in reſpect
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133423:6"/>of the <hi>Iriſh:</hi> they came into the Land by ſingle Families, or but few at a time; therefore, inſtead of Reforming them, they fell into the Manners, and Religion of the people of the Land; and after a while, did not fall ſhort of their new Country-men, even in their Hatred of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> A better Harveſt may be expected when many Families come into a Land to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Therefore the pleaſure that good men ought to take, in having the poor <hi>Iriſh,</hi> as well as the Soil, Cultivated, ſhould make them Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all their Aſſiſtance, as well as their good Wiſhes, to bring in a People who may help to Civilize ſuch parts of the Country, as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for want of ſufficient numbers, have not yet been able to do.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are excellent Handicraftment in all Trades; ſuch men are extreamly wanted in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and will Contribute to the Enriching, as well as Strengthening of this Kingdom. I know the Opinion of the Multitude is otherwiſe: The coming in of Out-landiſh Trades men is reckon'd a Grievance; and the Out-cry againſt you is, that you bring in Forreigners <hi>to take the Bread out of</hi> Engliſh mens <hi>Mouths.</hi> Ill natur'd Beaſts will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall upon Creatures of their own kind, if they eat near them, tho' there be much more Food than they can devour. I'm ſorry that Man, who is call'd a Sociable Creature, ſhould be troubled with a Temper which is ſo Deſtructive of Society: Do Forreigners eat the Bread out of their Mouths, when they have more Bread, than they have Mouths to devour it? But whom do theſe people call Forreigners? He is not to be reckoned a Forreigner to day, who yeſterday came into our Country upon Invitation; took Oaths required by our Laws; and made himſelf ſuch a Denizon, as will ſtrengthen our State, and Contribute to the laſting Peace of our Kingdom. If particular Perſons did Suffer by the coming in of Strangers, yet the great Good which the Common-wealth Reaps by it ought to Silence their Complaints. But let us ſee whether theſe men's Complaints are juſt or no. An Act for Naturalization Encourages Forreigners to come in: I ſuppoſe then that Fifty Families take Shipping at <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> Land in <hi>Waterford,</hi> and Settle there: if the men of thoſe Families are of differing Callings, then poſſibly they may not hurt any one Artizan of that ancient City; becauſe they will conſume the Labour of one anothers hands. For Example; Suppoſe one or two be Shoe-makers, and the reſt wear as many Shoes as they can make; then 'tis plain, that the Shoe-makers there are not Injur'd, and ſo it may be ſhewn in other particular Callings. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in of many people of differing Callings, and fixing in your Towns, will Improve thoſe Callings by the Addition of new, and perhaps ſome better Trades men: But that they cannot be ſuppoſed to prejudice the old Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I think is plain from this Conſideration, that if thoſe Forreigners ſhould keep themſelves entire in a Body, and Seat themſelves where there were not any other Trades-men before, no one will deny that theſe are able to live one upon another. Would not the Caſe then be the ſame, if they fell into Towns before Inhabited, and furniſhed with Trades-men? They muſt allow it, otherwiſe they muſt ſay, that the many Trades men of greater Cities, do not ſubſiſt one by another, as well as thoſe of ſmaller Hamlets.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:133423:6"/>
The men of the ſeveral Callings in <hi>Dublin,</hi> I ſuppoſe, Live at leaſt as well by their Callings, as they did 50 Years ago, tho' the City was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half as big as 'tis now,; and yet this Enlargement of the City was made by the Addition of more people of thoſe Callings. But ſuppoſe (as it may by chance happen) that more men of one Calling ſhould come into a City, or Town, than are ſufficient to Supply that City with the Labour of their Craft; is not this an Inconvenience and Prejudice to that City? No ſure: 'tis no Predjudice to the City of <hi>Waterford</hi> in General, for Example, to have more Haberdaſhers of Hats, or Hatters, as we call them here, fall in there, than are Neceſſary to Supply the Town, for if by that means bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hats are made, and they be ſold cheaper, then 'tis plain that the reſt of the Town are Gainers by it. But you'l ſay, what if this ſhould happen to be the Caſe of all the other Callings? This cannot be becauſe that when the men of all Callings do Increaſe, they Live one upon another, juſt as they did before, when they were fewer in number. But let us ſee what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies will follow from <hi>Waterford</hi>'s being clogg'd with too many Men of the Haters Trade, as ſome phraſe it; in ſuch a Caſe, either ſome of thoſe ſuperfluous Trades-men will enquire what other places of the Kingd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if by the caſual falling in of Trades-men, or other Accidents or Conveniencies, it ſhou'd happen that many Towns of the Kingdom ſhou'd run into one ſort of Trade, (as <hi>Rippon</hi> into the Trade, of Spurrs, <hi>Bermingham</hi> and <hi>Sheffield</hi> of Iron Ware) This wou'd be a mighty Advantage to the Kingdom, and the men of that Craft in thoſe places, for by this means, our Country wou'd almoſt every where be Improv'd, our Roads frequented and rendr'd ſecure from Robberies and there wou'd be a vaſt Commerce in the Kingdom. I wou'd ask thoſe people, who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the comming in of Forreign Trades-men, one Queſtion; whether it be not better that Forreign Trades-men ſhou'd be Encourag'd to live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, than that we ſhou'd be at the Charge of bringing their Goods out of <hi>France?</hi> this was our Caſe before the War, and will be again when we have a free Trade thither. Our people ſhou'd conſider that our Trades are not in the higheſt perfection in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but that people furniſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the portable work of almoſt all Callings from other places. The <hi>French</hi> are Famous for their great Skill in Manufactures. <hi>England</hi> muſt own that they have profited mightily by them ſince this War began, or rather I wou'd ſay ſince the Edict of <hi>Nantz</hi> was deſtroy'd, by the Improvement of the Silk Manufacture. The Linnen Manufacture is that which we may Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove: in this we ſhall not Rival <hi>England,</hi> for they give up this Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to us, without grudging, and reckon it to be the more peculiar Talent of <hi>Ireland.</hi> This is a Manufacture in which the <hi>French</hi> do excel; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               </gap>e comming in of the <hi>French,</hi> and their Improveing of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> are Remarkable for their Skill in Gardening and managing of Trees of all ſorts: 'tis not to be doubted then but if conſiderable numbers of them come into this Land, they will render it both Beautiful and profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by Improvements of that kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ireland</hi> wants Skilful and Induſtrious Husband-men as much as any place. In the condition 'tis now you can't expect to ſee men Induſtrious. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> are reckon'd a lazy people; but this I don't attribute to the natural temper of the Men, and the abundance of Flegm in their Bodies as is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppos'd, but rather to the want of Employment, and Encouragement to work. Sir <hi>William Petty</hi> computes that the work of one man in a Potato Garden will feed Forty people; and the Milk of one Cow will afford Meat and Drink enough in the Summer time for three men. Beſides there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Food round the Sea-ſhores which is procur'd with little or no pains. The Addition of people muſt Increaſe their Induſtry in Labouring the Ground. The <hi>French</hi> are allow'd to underſtand Husbandry, as well as any people, next the <hi>Flemings;</hi> and this enhances their value in <hi>Ireland</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove any thing elſe. 'Tis true indeed very many of that way of life are not yet come over, Husband-men are the laſt that quit a Country, by reaſon of the difficulty of diſpoſing of their Leaſes, and removing their Stock: But there is no doubt but very many of them will diſpoſe of their Effects in <hi>France,</hi> and ſeek a Retreat for their Religion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when they hear that they have ſome Incouragement to do it, and that their Brethren are Settled and well Entertain'd here.</p>
            <p>But I have heard ſome people ſay, that the <hi>French</hi> are very poor, and what Advantage, ſay they, is it to have ſuch come into a Land? 'Tis the Obſervation of a very Wiſe and Curious Obſerver, that they who grow Richeſt in a Country are they who come in poor: how can they arrive to this Wealth, but by great Induſtry and Improveing the Country? but thoſe men are miſtaken, the <hi>French,</hi> even who are in <hi>England,</hi> yet unſettled, and are diſpos'd to come into <hi>Ireland</hi> when Encouragement is given them, are not all poor: they have a great deale of Money among them, and will, if they come over, make a conſiderable Addition to the current Coyn of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But if they had no Money they would be nevertheleſs People: People are Wealth, and they have rates ſet upon them; The value of people in <hi>England,</hi> one with another, ſome have computed to be Seven pounds a Head: In <hi>Ireland</hi> I account the value of ſuch Proteſtant People as the <hi>French</hi> are (for I do make a Difference) to be much greater; becauſe in <hi>Ireland</hi> you are not only to value them as people who Improve the Country, but as Souldiers likewiſe who are to ſecure you and your Intereſt.

            <p>We cannot ſo much wonder at this, when we conſider, how many there are of the Children of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Souldiers in this Kingdom, who cannot ſpeak one word of <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And, which is ſtranger, the ſame may be ſaid of ſome of the Children of King <hi>William's</hi> Souldiers, who came but t'other day into the Country. This misfortune is oweing to the Marrying <hi>Iriſh</hi> women, for want of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who came not over in ſo great numbers as were requiſite. 'Tis ſure, that no <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> knows what his Children may be, as things are now: They cannot well live in the Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out growing <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for none take ſuch care as Sir <hi>Jerom Alexander</hi> did, who left his Eſtate to his Daughter, provided ſhe Married no <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> or any Related to that Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Since things are thus, the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> unleſs a great deal of care be taken, will out number us in a greater proportion than now they do: They are not Imploy'd in our Wars, as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> are; they Marry much younger than the <hi>Britiſh</hi> do; and get a great many Children before they Marry; and are not as ſeverely puniſhed for it as they might be. And beſides, as I ſaid, the Children of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by Converſing in the Country with them, learn their Language; admire their Cuſtoms; Marry with them very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and of courſe Embrace their Religion. What then can better ſecure us, and our Poſterity, than to Encourage great numbers of Forreign Proteſtants, who will Contribute to Reform the Manners and Religion of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and thus do God and the Country the greateſt Service, to come over, and take up their Habitations among us.</p>
            <p>I know 'twill be Objected by ſome, that the Remedy may be as bad as the Diſeaſe: that we cannot be ſecure, that the <hi>French</hi> will not help to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave us to a Forreign Nation. The Wiſe Heads of the Nation, ſufficiently conſidered this danger before they made the Act for Naturalization. The only Danger that is, or can be fear'd, is from the <hi>French</hi> King. 'Tis often ſaid, that the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants are proud of their Monarch's greatneſs, and ſeem to be pleas'd with his Succeſs. I ſhould not at all wonder, if ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this were true: 'Tis natural for men who are forc'd from their Country, and endure hardſhips in a ſtrange Land, to deſire to be thought conſiderable; and they may think, that it may give them ſome Reputation and Credit among ſtrangers, when they ſee and conſider, that they forſook a Prince, whoſe Power is great, and his Arms ſometimes Crown'd with Succeſs. I have heard it ſaid, that when we Burn'd the <hi>French</hi> Ships at <hi>Le Hoge,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Army, who were joyn'd with the <hi>French</hi> there rejoyced at it: And 'tis very well known, that many of thoſe <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen, who follow'd King <hi>James</hi> and his Fortune through <hi>France,</hi> into this Kingdom (whom we knew to be Bitter and Inviterate in their Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt their Native Country) becauſe they came in Competition with the <hi>Irish</hi> for their Places and Preferments, were Repreſented by them to be perſons ſo partially addicted to the people of <hi>England,</hi> that they could not well be truſted. But let us ſee what Danger may be fear'd from the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

I will ſuppoſe great numbers of <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants planted in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and I will ſuppoſe that the <hi>French</hi> King Lands a Body of men here. If he deſires his old Subjects (whom he has us'd ſo barbarouſly) ſhou'd repair to his Standard, and aſſiſt him in his Enterprize, he muſt put out a Declaration, wherein he muſt vow, much oftner than he did about the Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> (or elſe he will do no good) that tho' he was not ſo kind, to them, who help'd him to the Throne, as he might have been; tho' he had broken that Edict which he confirm'd by many Vows and Proclamations; tho' in that Edict, whereby, in the year 1685, he reſcinded the Edict of <hi>Nantz,</hi> he Declared to the World, that 'twas his Reſolution, from the very beginning of his Reign, to deſtroy the Religion of Proteſtants, whom he always reckon'd to be people fit to be treated with all manner of Injuries, and not capable of Leagues, and acts of kindneſs; and that all the Edicts he hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Publiſhed in their Favour, and all the Honours he Conferr'd upon them, were only to gull, and delude them; tho' he had Dragoon'd them too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; tho' he had forc'd them to the Gallies; and depriv'd too many of their Lives; yet now he promiſes and vows, more Solemnly then ever, that he will let them enjoy their Religion without Diſturbance. Who can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin that a people, who were ſo Inhumanly treated, after that their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is again Eſtabliſh'd; after that they are free'd from ſevere Exactions; and have taſted, and known the pleaſure of a mild and gentle Government; and have been very kindly Entertain'd in a ſtrange Land; will prove falſe to their Benefactors, and their own Intereſt: and run headlong into Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery again? I'm ſure there muſt be at leaſt as much reaſon for truſting them to live in <hi>Ireland</hi> now, as there was for uſeing their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance againſt Monſieur <hi>St. Ruth</hi> at the Battle of <hi>Aghrim;</hi> and none, I think, will deny that they behav'd themſelves very well there, as they have done in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others will Object that it may be of ill conſequence to Encourage <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants to Settle here, becauſe their Diſcipline, and way of Worſhip differ from that of our Eſtabliſh'd Church. 'Tis a great misfortune: that ſcarce any thing can be propos'd for the Publick good, which crafty men cannot Defeat, by Repreſenting it Dangerous, or Inconvenient to one party or other.</p>
            <p>There is nothing that I deſire more, than to ſee the day, when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Parties, ſo oppoſit to the Publick Good and Safety, ſhall be clearly, or in a great meaſure, taken away. Our moſt conſidering men, who are Zealous for our Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, and careful enough to Diſcountenance any thing that may poſſibly occaſion Troubles in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, know that there is no place for this Objection. They may, and do obſerve, that of all Forreign Proteſtants, none more readily Conſorm to the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than the <hi>French</hi> do; that many of the Famous Writers of that Church have, in their Writings in <hi>France,</hi> Expreſs'd their Approbation of an Epiſcopali Government; that they have a Legal Eſtabliſhed Church here; and that their Wiſe and Leading men, are enclin'd by their Judgment, as well as Intereſt, with the other Immunities of the Country, to embrace the publick Religion of it.

               </gap>he <hi>Iriſh</hi> grew to, conſidering the State of Affairs abroad, brought <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:133423:11"/>into ſome danger, all thinking men, I believe will allow: This they muſt own, that, if the Treaſure which was ſpent in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Armies which were employ'd here, had been ſent into <hi>Flanders, France</hi> had been humbled long ago, and we had been in poſſeſſion of an Honourable Peace. When this is conſider'd, it muſt be allow'd me, that if in former times Methods cou'd have been contriv'd to ſecure <hi>Ireland</hi> from theſe Troubles, tho' it were by ſuffering it to grow Rich, it had been the undoubted Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to do it. From hence I wou'd infer, that 'tis the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> at this preſent time, to do all that lies in its Power, to prevent ſuch Chargeable, Bloudy, and Dangerous Rebellions for the time to come. There is no way of doing it effectually but by Incourageing people to come and Plant here, People who will help to bring the Natives into Order, and keep them in Subjection. <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Earl of <hi>Surry</hi> Eldeſt Son of <hi>Thomas Duke</hi> of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk,</hi> who was made Lord Leivtenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year 1520, in a Letter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth to be ſeen in one of the Manuſcripts at <hi>Lambeth</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">

On which Saying we may make two Remarks, which I think will be very uſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> we ſee what a mighty Advantage it is to <hi>England</hi> that People come fairly in their way, of whom, by giving them ſome Incouragement, they may as well ſerve themſelves here, and keep their own people at home. It was then propos'd that the King wou'd Encourage <hi>Spaniards, Flemings, Almains,</hi> and others to come over; but from this the Earl diſſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King left they ſhould happen to fall into the Obedience of the Prince of their Native Country. This was a juſt caution at that time when the Power of <hi>Spain</hi> was ſo great, and all were of one Religion: it do's not hold in the caſe of the <hi>French,</hi> who are of the ſame Religion with us, and differ from the Religion of their King and Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> we ſee what the Great and Wiſe men reckoned the Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> that 'twas to ſubdue <hi>Ireland</hi> throughly, and put it into ſuch a condition that it ſhou'd not give any Diſturbance to <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony here. They were not afraid of Depopulating <hi>England,</hi> or of wanting men to ſend to raiſe Smoak in <hi>America. No, Ireland</hi> was their great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: They willingly ſent their People hither, and were very careful to make Ordinances, and Laws to keep them here. Hence it was that (as we find in a Manuſcript at <hi>Lambeth,</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.

               </note> Theſe Laws, I'm told, are ſtill in Force, and ſome have thought that if they had been duly executed, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> wou'd not have been able to grow to that Head in <hi>Ireland</hi> which they lately did. Whether this Conjecture be right or no I cannot tell: this I may ſay without offence, that the great Adventurers and Eſtated Men's living in <hi>England</hi> was always reckoned in former times one of the great Cauſes why <hi>Ireland</hi> was not brought into Subjection, I could wiſh that thoſe who have great Eſtates here wou'd take this into their Conſideration now. I find that among the other Inſtructions which the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> in the year 1573 gave <hi>Edward Waterhouſe</hi> to communicate to the Queen, this (which we find in one of Sir <hi>George Carew's</hi> Manuſcripts,
<note n="(b)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib. L L. fol.</hi> 8.</note> was one, that he ſhou'd inform her, that one great reaſon of the Armies being diminiſh'd in the North, and that the Country was in the hands of the Rebels, was the Adventurers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tireing themſelves to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon why I mention theſe things, is to ſhew, that in former times <hi>England</hi> did not regard any Advantage of its own which might interfere with the ſecurity of this Kingdom: how plain wou'd this be, if I ſhould give an account of the Ancient Immunities granted by our Kings to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations here, and ſhew on t'other ſide how the Trade now is Prohibited and fetter'd by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Statutes. This our Friends in <hi>England</hi> ſay, is Policy; and 'tis a maxim among them, that 'tis their Intereſt to keep <hi>Ireland</hi> low. If by their Intereſt they mean the Intereſt of ſome privat men, who have Ends of their own to ſerve diſtinct from the Publick Good; and if by <hi>Ireland</hi> they mean the <hi>Popiſh Iriſh</hi> Intereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> then I allow that what they ſay may be true. I think 'tis the undoubted Intereſt of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>England,</hi> that thoſe who are of the Proteſtant Religion, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt in <hi>Ireland</hi> be very numerous, and that under them this Kingdom Flouriſh and grow Rich. The King will allow, and ſo muſt every one that 'tis His Intereſt to have His Power and Strength increas'd by the increaſe of Loyal Subjects: and his Revenue made greater by the growth of their Wealth. And when the thing is duly conſider'd it muſt be allowed that 'tis no leſs the Intereſt of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> then of the King. What can be more convenient for <hi>England</hi> than to have a Kingdom ſo near it, which will be able to raiſe and maintain a conſiderable Body of Proteſtant Souldiers whenever there is occaſion?

The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er we are in Riches, and People, the abler we ſhall be, not only to Defeat any Rebellions at home, or Deſcents from abroad, which may be ultimatly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd againſt <hi>England;</hi> but alſo to lend a Conſiderable Aſſiſtanance to our Mother-Country in any neceſſary War ſhe's Ingag'd in I think 'tis the Opinion of every <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, that 'tis the undoubted Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to keep Poſſeſſion of <hi>Ireland:</hi> If ſo, then I wou'd fain ſee ſome Reaſon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why 'tis not the Intereſt of the People of <hi>England</hi> to render <hi>Ireland</hi> ſecure, and make it Wealthy as well as <hi>England.</hi> To ſay that <hi>Ireland</hi> is a Conquer'd Country is no Reaſon: for wiſe Nations when they Conquer Countries with a Deſign to keep them, do propoſe to themſelves to add to the Grandeur, Strength, and Wealth of their own Country by it: but how is this to be done, but by Improveing their Conqueſt, and by Immunities, and Encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agements rendering them as like their own as they can? and I think it may ſeem a little ſtrange that a Nation fam'd for wiſdom and Equity as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> are, ſhou'd not after above 520 years poſſeſſion, in a Country ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently Situated, ſo good, ſo improveable as <hi>Ireland</hi> is, order things ſo, as that, the very name of <hi>Conquer'd,</hi> (which has a very miſchievous Idea join'd to it) and all manner of Jealouſies being taken away, both Iſlands might be rendred one in all their Intereſts. If they were made one Kingdom (which I wiſh that this Reign, and our preſent great Miniſters of State in <hi>England</hi> may have the Glory of accompliſhing.) I believe <hi>England</hi> wou'd then rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it their Intereſt to help to make this Country as Conſiderable and Strong as they cou'd by promoting the increaſe of our Wealth, and the growth of Proteſtant People; and they wou'd no more grumble at our Proſperity, than the North of <hi>England</hi> dos at the happineſs of the South. If ſuch a Country as <hi>Ireland</hi> is, well peopled and Wealthy, were join'd to <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:133423:12"/>juſt as <hi>Wales</hi> is, I would ask whether <hi>England</hi> would not be put into a better condition than before. The <hi>Hollanders,</hi> who take a great deal of pains to gain ground from the Sea, will allow it: and he that denies it, muſt be forc'd to own, that <hi>England</hi> is not the better for the Addition of <hi>Wales;</hi> and that 'twould be no worſe, if <hi>Wales,</hi> and many of its own Shires were lopp'd off from it. But 'twill be ſaid, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is not contiguous, and joyn'd to <hi>England</hi> as I ſuppoſe: Tho' it be not, it may be made one Kingdom with it, and then 'twould be much the better for being divided from it by the Sea as it is: For now the two Iſlands have more good Ports between them, than they would have if they joyn'd together; the Wealth and Naval force of <hi>England</hi> would be greater, by means of the Shiping that muſt be employ'd between the two Countries. And 'tis ſure that we can't eaſily imagin, how great the Power and Wealth of <hi>England</hi> would be, as the Kingdoms are now placed, if they were made one Kingdom; if <hi>England</hi> would take off the Shackles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> make us a Free people, and we gave Forreign Proteſtants Encouragement to live here. I'm ſure, if <hi>Ireland</hi> had been in ſuch a condition long ago, <hi>England</hi> would have ſome Millions of Money, and a vaſt Treaſure of Men which it now wants. But ſome do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin that <hi>Ireland</hi> cannot grow in Wealth but by Impoveriſhing <hi>England,</hi> or hindering the growth of its Wealth. They may as well ſay that they cannot have a conſiderable Addition to their Proteſtant people without making <hi>England</hi> weaker. The Increaſe of Wealth in <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt Increaſe that of <hi>England;</hi> for whatſoever Fountain our Wealth here ſprings from, what ever Conduits it runs thro', it in the end empties it ſelf in <hi>England. Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> may be render'd very Wealthy by a Trade which will not in the leaſt interfere with that of <hi>England. Ireland</hi> is by a great many reckon'd equal to moſt Countries in the World, for the production of Flax and Hemp; the Natives of the Country ſeem to be naturally enclin'd to this Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. 'Tis plain by the Act of Parliament made not long ſince in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to take off all Duties and Impoſitions on the Product of Flax and Hemp from <hi>Ireland,</hi> that <hi>England</hi> is well enclined to humour the genius of <hi>Ireland.</hi> When we conſider what a hand <hi>Holland, France,</hi> and the Northern Crowns, have made of this Manufacture, we may well allow that <hi>Ireland,</hi> which has naturally greater advantages to improve it, may be greatly enrich'd by it. If we did but furniſh <hi>England</hi> with that Linnen which they have from our neighbouring Countries, this wou'd raiſe us a vaſt Treaſure, but I can't ſee what prejudice it would do <hi>England.</hi> It ſeems to me to be at leaſt as much their Intereſt to lay out their money with us, who ſhall employ it in their defence, and are their ſelves, as with them who will make it an Inſtrument of their ruin. 'Tis the Computation of a very great man, that the people of <hi>England</hi> ſpend 5<abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> a year in Linnen one with another; this Computation I ſuppoſe is much too large, if the 30th. part of this were laid out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 'twould be three times as much as the current caſh of this Kingdom has ever yet been. It cannot eaſily be conceiv'd how much 'tis <hi>England</hi>'s Intereſt to have this Manufacture improv'd to the heighth. 'Tis probable that this will be the effect of Encourageing Forreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:133423:13"/>to flock hither; this may draw in not only the <hi>French,</hi> but many others likewiſe.</p>
            <p>Since 'tis ſo much our Intereſt to have Forreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſettle here,
<note place="margin">How Forreigners may be encourag'd</note> it concerns us to conſider how we may incourage them to come in.</p>
            <p>The Parliament which was held in my Lord <hi>Rumney</hi>'s Government, in the year 1692, made an Act which Naturaliz'd all Forreign Proteſtants; but that was to be in Force only for Seven years. Since that Law will be out of Date within two years, I think, Sir, 'twill become the Wiſdom of the Nation, to make a new Act which ſhall be in force Twenty years after the expiration of the old one; and 'twill be for the Publick good, I think, that by this Law, Forreigners be not only Naturaliz'd, but made Free of our Corporations likewiſe: This will be for the advantage of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and will not injure particular Trades men, as men upon firſt ſight are apt to imagin.</p>
            <p>To vouchſafe Strangers the Freedom of your Country, is the firſt Incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the firſt Act of Kindneſs and Hoſpitality that you can ſhew them: But this, in good truth, is no more than to give Rich men leave to bring in their Wealth, and the Poor leave to beg in your Country. I cou'd wiſh that all whom it concerns, wou'd ſeriouſly conſider, whether it be not worth the while to lay another bait to draw them in? Whether, that after you have conſider'd the real value of People, you will not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it money well laid out, if you ſhould raiſe a fund not exceeding — to be given to poor Proteſtants, who bring in their Families to ſettle here? I would have this money diſtributed among the poor <hi>French</hi> eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been great Sufferers on the account of Religion. The greateſt Incouragement ſhould be for men of Callings; and thoſe ſhou'd have moſt, who have Wives and moſt Children. This cannot be call'd a Burthen to the Nation, becauſe 'twill be ſpent in the Kingdom, and will increaſe its Wealth for the time to come. This will not draw in the poor alone, but the Rich likewiſe, for they will be fond of living among a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who make ſuch Proviſion for their poor.</p>
            <p>And becauſe I have ſhewn that 'tis the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to Incourage Forreign Proteſtants to ſettle here, 'tis to be hop'd that, if it can be done, ſome meaſures will be thought of, to prevail upon the King and People of <hi>England,</hi> to raiſe ſome Fund there, to help poor Forreigners to come over hither.</p>
            <p>When this is done, I think, Sir, that our great Council wou'd do that which would make their Memory dear to poſtority, if they would Addreſs the Government, and pray that they would ſignifie to His Majeſty, that 'tis the requeſt of His great Council here, that, for promoting the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, and Secureing the Peace of this Nation for the time to come, he would in the Grants he makes of Forfeited Lands take ſome care to have Proteſtants planted in them. If in every Eſtate Granted by the King, the perſon to whom the Grant is made, were oblig'd to plant a conſiderable number of Proteſtants in proportion to the Land which is given him: and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:133423:13"/>if they were oblig'd to ſet out a good part of thoſe Eſtates to Proteſtant Tenants in Leaſes for Lives, at a ſmall Rent firſt, and to be rais'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, this, I think, would have a very good Effect, and would go a great way towards making the Country Rich and Secure.</p>
            <p>There is another thing which I could wiſh the Wiſdom of our Nation would ſeriouſly conſider, Whether it would not be very much for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the King would grant at leaſt a part of the Forfeited Lands not yet diſpoſed of, to Forreign Proteſtants; particularly (and that for very good reaſons) to the <hi>French?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe when they conſider the thing impartially, they will own it. I find that in the year 1583, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Inſtructions which She gave Sir <hi>John Perrot</hi> ſent Lord Deputy into <hi>Ireland,</hi> when She talks of Diſpoſing of Forfeited Lands here, tells him that She's for giving no more to one than he's able to furniſh people for.
<note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Manuſcript. Lambeth. L. C. pag.</hi> 35.</note> If the King gives Grants to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> (without this care taken) they muſt take up with the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tenents that are upon the Land, and things muſt run on in their old courſe: If they furniſh people out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> this will unpeople <hi>England,</hi> and impoveriſh it, which 'tis our Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to have full of People and Wealth, that we may live the more ſecure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its protection. The great Body of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants are at this day in a very uneaſie and unſettled condition, and no one knows how many of them would make this Country a place of Retreat from their ſevere Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, if they heard that the King of <hi>Great Britain</hi> had granted them Lands to ſettle upon. And when I ſpeak this, I cannot but take notice that I think it a great happineſs, that the Forfeitures not yet diſpos'd of are in <hi>Conaught:</hi> If great numbers of the <hi>French</hi> were planted there, that Country which is thineſt of Proteſtants, would be render'd as Secure as any part of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Before the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, till the Eſcheated Counties were planted with Proteſtant Inhabitants, and the <hi>Londoners</hi> Built <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Colrane,</hi> the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> gave the greateſt diſturbance to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Since thoſe Plantations have been made there, it has been the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureſt retreat from the Inſurrections of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> If a conſiderable Colony of Proteſtants were planted in <hi>Conaught,</hi> 'twould be impoſſible for the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to diſturb the peace of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Country for the time to come. I have heard a Perſon of Quality, who is your Relation, ſpeak of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſt which I think would, if it were put in Execution, render that part of the Country ſecure. If the King, after that he has oblig'd thoſe whom their Merits Recommend to His Favour, would be pleas'd to Grant Lands in this Province to the <hi>French,</hi> and would take care to appoint Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to ſee it planted by them, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> mixed together, He would take an effectual courſe to Secure and Enrich this Kingdom, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triev'd from Miſery and Slavery, by the hazard of His Life. When the Parliament conſiders this, they perhaps may think it proper to pray the Government, that they would Repreſent this to the King beſides theſe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:133423:14"/>publick Grants and Emulaments, 'tis to be hop'd that the Proteſtant No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of this Kingdom, will (when they conſider the great want and value of good people in this Country) give private Incouragements to Forreign Proteſtants to come into the Kingdom, and ſettle upon their Eſtates. In Order to Promote this, I could wiſh that in the Act of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralization it were Enacted, that at the Publick charge, four Folio Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts well Bound were purchaſed; the Firſt of theſe called the Book of <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> to be placed in <hi>Dublin;</hi> the Second called the Book of <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In theſe Books I wou'd have the Nobility and Gentry of the Reſpective Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces enter the Incouragements they will give to Forreign Proteſtants to Settle in their Eſtate, <hi>viz.</hi> How many Tenements they will ſet out, with what Lands Annex'd to them; whether the Leaſe ſhall be for Lives, or a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able term of years; (and I cou'd wiſh that they wou'd conſider that the true way to make <hi>Ireland</hi> Flouriſh, is to let Leaſes for Lives as in <hi>England,</hi> and to Encourage Tillage) how long they ſhall be Rent free; and what the Rent ſhall be after ſuch time; what <hi>Bonâ ſide,</hi> the Land is worth an Acre as the Land thereabouts is now Set? How many Tenements they have parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for Linnen Weavers; for this will be a good way to Incourage the Linnen Manufacture; and if the Parliament wou'd in all, or (for a Specimen) in ſome Counties, where the Linnen Manufacture is moſt Improv'd, order large Bleaching Yards to be made in ſuch places of thoſe Counties, or the Neighbouring County as — Juſtices of the Peace of the County with the Advice of — Perſons whoſe imployment it has been to make Linnen; theſe Bleaching Yards to be put into the hands of the beſt Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be procur'd at home or a broad, and they to Whiten Cloath at a rate ſet by the Parliament; this I conceive might go a great way in Improveing our Linnen Manufacture. What Incouragement is thus given I wou'd have entered in the Reigiſtry by the Gentlemans own hand; or if he ſend his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in a Letter to the Regiſter, I would have two Witneſſes hands to the Letter, and it ſhould be kept on Record. The Reaſon is becauſe I wou'd have whatever Incouragement is thus given as Binding in Law as if it were a Deed, and the poor Forrigner who accepts the Propoſal ſhou'd have Liberty to ſue in <hi>Formâ Pauperis,</hi> and all the Kings Council ſhou'd be oblig'd to ſee him righted, as if it were the Kings Suit. Such proviſions and ſecurity, as this from the Publick Faith will Encourage Forreigners to venture into the Kingdom. When ſuch publick Regiſtries are Settled, Forreigners will have their Agent in the Kingdom to take an Account of the Incouragement that is given and if the Nobillty and Gentry wou'd be generous in their Propoſals, and wou'd regard rather the good of their poſterity, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and Flouriſhing Eſtate of the Kingdom for the time to come, than their
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:133423:14"/>own preſent gain, no one can tell what a multitude of uſeful people they may bring into the Kingdom by this means. That theſe Encouragements maybe made as publick as may be, I wou'd have Tranſcripts of the Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments entred in the Book of <hi>Conaught</hi> ſent Monthly to the Regiſter of <hi>Cork</hi> and <hi>Dublin,</hi> and thoſe entred in <hi>Cork, Conaught</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> ſent likewiſe to <hi>Dublin.</hi> And that Foreigners may have the more Encouragement to Settle here, I would have them exempted, at leaſt for Seven years, from the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Church-Wardens, Conſtables, Jurors, and from publick Taxes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what Goods they bring in at their firſt coming ſhou'd be Duty Free, but then they muſt give Security to pay for them, if they don't ſettle in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, Sir, that theſe Propoſals on the firſt Reflection, will ſeem very Wild and Extravagant: and 'twill be thought ill Husbandry thus to Bribe, and hire men to do themſelves a kindneſs. Before men cenſure too raſhly, I deſire they wou'd conſider the great, (I had almoſt ſaid the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) value of people; and the ill Report that frequent Rebellions have brought upon the Country, which is a Lyon in the way, that frightens For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners from coming hither. What is thus given can do us no harm, for the Money will in effect, be raiſed only to Improve the Kingdom, and that Land which is given to draw Forreigners in to Plant and Improve it, will not, I'm ſure, be carryed out of the Country.</p>
            <p>Some may very juſtly ask why I dont propoſe that <hi>Engliſh</hi> people rather be thus Encourag'd to come and ſettle here, ſo I wou'd (for they are the people that wou'd be uſeful to us) if I were not very ſure, that this wou'd be taken ill in <hi>England.</hi> I'm for gaining as many uſeful Foreigners as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and if we cou'd draw in great numbers of the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, this wou'd be an Act of great Charity to them, a great blow to the <hi>French</hi> King, and the greateſt kindneſs that we can do our ſelves.</p>
